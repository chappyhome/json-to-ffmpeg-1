echo "The issue is likely that:"
echo "1. SFX clips are padded with silence to their timeline positions"
echo "2. Each padded SFX has different total length"
echo "3. When mixed with amix, the longest SFX determines the track length"
echo "4. If the longest padded SFX is shorter than totalLength (10s),"
echo "   then apad adds silence, but this might affect the amix ratio"
